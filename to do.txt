High priority:
------------------------

Long press / drag should show a mini detailed view
	- calculate what element is under current X/Y coordinates
	- different views for each table mode
Option buttons
	- Organize into groups/subgroups
	- Search should go under inspect mode
	- Add range selectors below phase and discovery mode

Medium priority:
------------------------
Make elements always square
	- keep aspect ratio of table
	- this might mess with calculating what's under the cursor!
The "picture" category is broken on iPhone 3

Low priority:
------------------------
Bohr model
	- 3d stuff?
	- animation with play/pause button
	- make a unit for size and base everything off that
Move document.ready stuff to separate spots
Add Molar Mass calculator
