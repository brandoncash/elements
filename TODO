TODO:

Make back button go to table view if not already there

switch to ftscroller?

make photo/radius/etc go to their respective pages in the inspector

update other graphs to use e.originalEvent.touches[0].clientX
	-- does this update on move?

there are a few px where the selected element in atomic radii view doesn't line up with the graph's selected element

hydrides/oxides/chlorides
	- move line breaks into generated markup
	- same for "non stoich"
	- some (42-molybdenum) have things like [x=2-6]
		- don't <sub> the numbers
		- make it <small>
		- not new line




Special thanks
	- Chapps for vector icons
